# Senior Project

Welcome to the repository for the **Senior Project**, where we gather all relevant information and resources for the project titled:

**"SDN-based Dynamic Network Resource Management Using Reinforcement Learning Techniques to Enhance IoT Efficiency in Smart Building"**

---

## Project Overview
This project aims to address the challenges of network resource management in IoT-enabled smart buildings by leveraging **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Our goal is to create a dynamic system that enhances the efficiency, scalability, and reliability of IoT networks.

### Objectives
- Develop an SDN-based framework for real-time network resource allocation.
- Utilize reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize network performance dynamically.
- Improve the quality of service (QoS) and energy efficiency for IoT devices in smart buildings.
